- write comments in lowercase and be succinct
- write error messages and logging messages in lowercase
- run outputs through `tracing`
- run errors through `anyhow`, prefer using `.context()` to other methods of converting errors to `anyhow::Error`
- prefer calls like `f32::clamp(a, b, c)` to `a.clamp(b, c)` for readability
- prefer to use `min`/`max` from `std::cmp` to reduce verbosity
- maintain a utility module containing functions like `median()` and other
  commonly used math utility functions to reduce the cognitive load of reading a
  median implementation
